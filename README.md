A simple character config copier for FFXIV!

The current cloud system is nice to have + to backup, but to copy individual things to one (or more) characters is annoying.

This will make it fast and easy! 

## Installation 
Just download the latest from [Releases](https://github.com/BirdSamuel/FFCopier/releases), extract all files to a folder, and launch `FFCopier.exe`.

## Usage
Use the "From" or "To" dropdowns and tap "Add new character...". A dialog will help you browse to your FFXIV characters folders and select one. 

They're usually at C:/User/Documents/My Games/Final Fantasy XIV - A Realm Reborn/, and look like FFXIV_CHR004000XXXXXXXXXX.

You'll have to figure out which character is which, then assign the name to them. 

Usually you can log in to a character, modify something, and check the last modified date on some of the .DAT files to verify.


## 

Once multiple characters are added, simply choose who to copy From + To, and select which configs you'd like to copy! That's it!

Thanks for reading! Hope you enjoy!
